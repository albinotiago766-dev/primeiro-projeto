Deterministic List Analyzer (Python)

A small, deterministic Python algorithm that analyzes a list of integers and returns:

- Sum of all prime numbers
- Quantity of even numbers
- Largest odd number

Designed to be deterministic, efficient, and free of external dependencies.

## Example

```python
from main import analisar_lista

result = analisar_lista([3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 2])
print(result)
# Output: (36, 4, 13)
